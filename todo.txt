Right now when a participant chooses a new sound, it fires off a 
message to other participants to load that sound that they are ready
when the gesture hits the play line, to play it:

comm.registerCallback('addToSoundbank', function(data, src) {
			console.log("add to soundbank for remote client " + data[0]);
			soundSelect.loadSound(data[0],function(sfactory){
				console.log("loaded sound for remote client")
				soundbank.addSnd(data[0], sfactory, 12); // max polyphony 
			});

However, if the new participant joined AFTER the other selected a new sound,
then the system crashes when the gesture tries to play at the now line.

Fix the STATE in the server code.
The idea is to have the server maintain state, so that when  new member joins, he can
get all the info necessary to jump in to the middle of a score.
I started experimenting with just keeping the current sound selections for sources, but
   array isn't the right data structure for this (what if there are just 2 players with 
   very high ide numbers?)

Fix the room joining thing - right now, I don't think you can join 2 rooms yet.
