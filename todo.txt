Right now when a participant chooses a new sound, it fires off a 
message to other participants to load that sound that they are ready
when the gesture hits the play line, to play it:

comm.registerCallback('addToSoundbank', function(data, src) {
			console.log("add to soundbank for remote client " + data[0]);
			soundSelect.loadSound(data[0],function(sfactory){
				console.log("loaded sound for remote client")
				soundbank.addSnd(data[0], sfactory, 12); // max polyphony 
			});

However, if the new participant joined AFTER the other selected a new sound,
then the system crashes when the gesture tries to play at the now line.
